<h2>Welcome to Mpaxs</h2>
Mpaxs is a light parallelization framework for Java that allows for transparent submission and execution
of serializable Runnable and Callable tasks on local or remote virtual machines. Tasks are transparently submitted using
<code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code>. 
Mpaxs automatically comissions new compute hosts via its compute host launcher infrastructure for grid- and cloud-based execution
to dynamically adapt to changing workload.
