<h2>Getting Started</h2>

1. Please download and install [Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or JDK version 1.6.0 or newer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for 
          your specific platform and operating system.

2. Then [download Mpaxs](./download.html) and follow the installation instructions.

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
  
Download the zip-distribution of Mpaxs and include the jar files in the lib/ folder on the classpath of 
your project. 

<h3>Demonstration</h3>
  
The zip-distribution of Mpaxs includes a self-contained demo that may be run from the command line: 

    > java -jar mpaxs.jar

This will print the available options:

    usage: net.sf.mpaxs.spi.computeHost.StartUp [-m <mjobs>] [-n <nhosts>] [-r
           <runmode>]
    -m <mjobs>     Number of jobs to run in parallel
    -n <nhosts>    Number of hosts for parallel processing
    -r <runmode>   The mode in which to operate: one of
                   <ALL,LOCAL,DISTRIBUTED>

In order to run mpaxs demo locally within the active virtual machine with 100 jobs and 1 thread, type in the following:

    > java -jar mpaxs.jar -m 100 -n 1 -r LOCAL

<p class="alert alert-info">
<b>Note:</b><br/>
Mpaxs will try to launch new compute hosts using the drmaa api 
by default. If no drmaa-compatible scheduling system, such as Globus, SGE/OGE,
Torque, or PBS is installed on your system, mpaxs will automatically fall back 
to launch the compute hosts on your local system within seperate processes. 
</p>

If you have a cluster scheduling system installed, you can try to run mpaxs demo with 
a larger maximum number of hosts and jobs in distributed mode:

    > java -jar mpaxs.jar -m 100000 -n 3 -r DISTRIBUTED

<p class="alert alert-info">
<b>Note:</b><br/>
Compute hosts are launched on demand by mpaxs. Thus, if the active compute hosts can easily 
cater for the submitted jobs, mpaxs will not launch any new hosts. If a compute host is idle 
for a pre-defined time, it will initiate an orderly shutdown of itself and deregister with the 
master server.
</p>

<h3>Launching a local execution with non-blocking wait</h3>

    CompletionServiceFactory<Long> csf = new CompletionServiceFactory<Long>();
    csf.setTimeOut(1);
    csf.setTimeUnit(TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    csf.setMaxThreads(maxThreads);
    csf.setBlockingWait(false);

    final ICompletionService<Long> cs = csf.newLocalCompletionService();
    for(int i = 0; i< maxJobs; i++) {
        //!!! this callable is NOT serializable !!!
        cs.submit(new Callable<Long>() {
            @Override
            public Long call() throws Exception {
                long sum = 0;
                for (int i = Integer.MIN_VALUE; i < Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++) {
                    sum += i;
                }
                if (Math.random() > 0.9) {
                    throw new IOException("Failed on io due to simulated random error!");
                }
                return Long.valueOf(sum);
            }
        });
    }
    List<Long> results = mcs2.call();
    System.out.println("Local Results (Local Host execution): " + results);

If you want automatic resubmission of failed jobs, wrap the completion service before submitting 
jobs to it:

    //try to rerun failed tasks up to three times to catch 
    //randomly occurring runtime exceptions
    final ICompletionService<Long> rcs = csf.asResubmissionService(cs,3);

<h3>Launching a remote execution</h3>

You need to have a local DRMAA-comatible grid engine locally installed. There are a number 
of different implementations available. For Ubuntu Linux, you may want to install the [Open Grid Scheduler](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gridengine) packages 
following [this tutorial](http://helms-deep.cable.nu/~rwh/blog/?p=159). Do not forget to install the drmaa java api bindings.

Users that want to use the grid engine should alter their own <code>.profile</code> or the admin could add a script file under <code>/etc/profile.d/</code> to add 
<code>export SGE_ROOT="/var/lib/gridengine"</code> (under Ubuntu) and <code>export SGE_CELL="CELL"</code>, where you should replace <code>CELL</code> with the cell name you entered 
during package installation.

<p class="alert alert-info">
<b>Note:</b><br/>
If you have problems starting up either the master or the exec instances,
have a look at your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. It seems, that the implementation only works if your host's IP (may be 127.0.0.1 for local only operation) with hostname (NOT localhost) is the first entry.
If that is missing, try to insert a new entry at the top of the file with your current IP and hostname. 
</p>

We have successfully used Mpaxs with Oracle Grid Engine on Solaris and the Open Grid Scheduler on Linux with +50 hosts and > 200000 jobs. 

    //Define the location of the compute host jar, this could be your own extended version
    File computeHostJarLocation = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir"), "mpaxs.jar");
    if (!computeHostJarLocation.exists() || !computeHostJarLocation.isFile()) {
        throw new IOException("Could not locate mpaxs.jar in " + System.getProperty("user.dir"));
    }
    final PropertiesConfiguration cfg = new PropertiesConfiguration();
    //set execution type
    cfg.setProperty(ConfigurationKeys.KEY_EXECUTION_MODE, ExecutionType.DRMAA);
    //set location of compute host jar
    cfg.setProperty(ConfigurationKeys.KEY_PATH_TO_COMPUTEHOST_JAR, computeHostJarLocation);
    //exit to console when master server shuts down
    cfg.setProperty(ConfigurationKeys.KEY_MASTER_SERVER_EXIT_ON_SHUTDOWN, true);
    //limit the number of used compute hosts
    cfg.setProperty(ConfigurationKeys.KEY_MAX_NUMBER_OF_CHOSTS, 3);
    //native specs for the drmaa api
    cfg.setProperty(ConfigurationKeys.KEY_NATIVE_SPEC, "");

    Impaxs impxs = ComputeServerFactory.getComputeServer();
    impxs.startMasterServer(cfg);
    CompletionServiceFactory<Double> csf = new CompletionServiceFactory<Double>();
    final ICompletionService<Double> mcs = csf.newDistributedCompletionService();
    for (int i = 0; i < maxJobs; i++) {
        //TestCallable is within the mpaxs-test module, net.sf.mpaxs.test
        mcs.submit(new TestCallable());
    }
    List<Double> results = mcs.call();
    System.out.println("Distributed execution: " + results);
    impxs.stopMasterServer();
