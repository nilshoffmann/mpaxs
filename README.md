# Mpaxs

Mpaxs is a light parallelization framework for Java that allows for transparent submission and execution of serializable Runnable and Callable tasks on local or remote virtual machines. Tasks are transparently submitted using java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService. Mpaxs automatically comissions new compute hosts via its compute host launcher infrastructure for grid- and cloud-based execution to dynamically adapt to changing workload.
